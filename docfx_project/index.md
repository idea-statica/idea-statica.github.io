# Idea StatiCa API Documentation

This might eventually become a place, where Idea API docs will be concentrated. 

In experimental stage for now.

## Quick Start Tutorials:

Automating the calculation of an existing Connection LINK

Automating the creation and calculation of a Connection LINK

Developing a BIM link

## Available Libraries

Here, we should explain what IdeaStatiCa.Plugin does and what Idea OpenModel does.

Documentation for IdeaStatica.Plugin (autogenerated) LINK

Documentation for IdeaRS.OpenModel (autogenerated) LINK

## Automating the calculation of an existing Connection

```python
import ideastatica

conn = Ideaconnection()
conn.open("example_model.ideaCon")
conn.update_param("weld_thickness", "8.0")
conn.calculate()
results = conn.get_results()
print(results)
conn.close()
```
